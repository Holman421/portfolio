# Three.js Gradient Glass Effect - React Version

This is a React implementation of the Three.js gradient glass effect with smooth transitions between sections. The effect creates a visually appealing gradient glass background that changes based on scroll position.

## Features

- Beautiful shader-based gradient glass effect
- Smooth transitions between sections when scrolling
- Interactive mouse movement effects
- Responsive design that adapts to window resizing
- Post-processing effects for enhanced visual appeal

## Implementation Details

This React component implements the following:

- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management and lifecycle
- Separates shader color definitions from configuration parameters
- Makes pattern controls respond to scroll position changes
- Creates smooth transitions between sections during scrolling
- Ensures proper initialization on component mount
- Cleans up resources when component unmounts

## Usage

```jsx
import GradientGlassEffect from './path/to/react-three-js-shaders-gradient-glass';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <GradientGlassEffect />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Dependencies

- React
- Three.js
- GSAP (with ScrollTrigger plugin)

## How it Works

1. The component initializes a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
2. Shader materials are created with uniform values that control the visual effect
3. ScrollTrigger tracks the page scroll position
4. As the user scrolls, the shader parameters are interpolated between section configurations
5. Cubic easing is applied for smooth transitions
6. The mouse position is tracked for interactive effects

## Performance Considerations

- The component uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Resources are properly disposed when unmounting
- The shader complexity is optimized for good performance

## Customization

You can customize the effect by modifying:

1. The shader colors in the `shaderColors` object
2. The section configurations in the `sectionConfigs` array
3. The transition timing and easing in the animation loop
